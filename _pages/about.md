I’m a senior clinical scientist (senior MRI physicist) at [Canon Medical Systems USA](https://us.medical.canon/) where I work to translate innovative imaging solutions (Deep Learning Reconstruction, Compressed Sensing, Ultra-short Echo Time (UTE) imaging, Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), etc.) to the clinical environment by designing and conducting hypothesis-driven and clinical-evaluation research studies and engaging in the FDA 510(k) application processes. I have a track record of successful collaborations with radiologists, cardiologists, scientists, engineers, application specialists, MRI technologists, product managers, marketers, legal counselors, and regulatory affairs specialists.

I enjoy learning new knowledge, generating new ideas, experimenting with new tools, and solving impactful problems in principal ways. My expertise and interests include:

-   Design and execute scientific, FDA 510(k)-cleared, and hypothesis-driven research studies

-   End-to-end project managements and interdisciplinary collaborations

-   Fundamental and translational MRI research related to quantitative imaging, novel pulse sequence design, and advanced image reconstruction

-   Applications of statistics, data science, machine learning, and deep learning to medical imaging and healthcare

-   Programmable animation, data visualization, data analysis, and statistics using Python and R

-   Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming for quantitative imaging with uncertainty quantification

-   Mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and optimization

-   Automatic and reproducible pipelines for data curation, cleaning, and visualization, statistical analysis, and report/presentation generation using Git version control, nbdev, Bash, Python, R, and related packages

In my spare time, I enjoy walking, jogging, running, and learning the latest advances in science and technology.
