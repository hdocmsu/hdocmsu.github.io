  abstract = {Objective: To prospectively evaluate a deep learning-based denoising reconstruction (DLR) for improved resolution and image quality in musculoskeletal (MSK) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Images from 137 contrast-weighted sequences in 40 MSK patients were evaluated. Each sequence was performed twice, first with the routine parameters and reconstructed with a routine reconstruction filter (REF), then with higher resolution and reconstructed with DLR, and with three conventional reconstruction filters (NL2, GA43, GA53). The five reconstructions (REF, DLR, NL2, GA43, and GA53) were de-identified, randomized, and blindly reviewed by three MSK radiologists using eight scoring criteria and a forced ranking. Quantitative SNR, CNR, and structure's full width at half maximum (FWHM) for resolution assessment were measured and compared. To account for repeated measures, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with Bonferroni adjustment was used to compare the reader's scores, SNR, CNR, and FWHM between DLR vs. NL2, GA43, GA53, and REF. Results: Compared to the routine REF images, the resolution was improved by 47.61% with DLR from 0.39±0.15 mm2 to 0.20±0.06 mm2 (p<0.001). Per-sequence average scan time was shortened by 7.93% with DLR from 165.58±21.86 s to 152.45±25.65 s (p<0.001). Based on the average scores, DLR images were rated significantly higher in all image quality criteria and the forced ranking (p<0.001). Conclusion: This prospective clinical evaluation demonstrated that DLR allows approximately two times finer resolution and improved image quality compared to the standard-of-care images.}

  abstract = {Football exposes its players to traumatic brain, neck, and spinal injury. It is unknown whether the adolescent football player develops imaging abnormalities of the brain and spine that are detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The objective of this observational study was to identify potential MRI signatures of early brain and cervical spine (c-spine) injury in high school football players. Eighteen football players (mean age, 17.0 ± 1.5 years; mean career length, 6.3 ± 4.0 years) had a baseline brain MRI, and 7 had a follow-up scan 9–42 months later. C-spine MRIs were performed on 11 of the 18 subjects, and 5 had a follow-up scan. C-spine MRIs from 12 age-matched hospital controls were also retrospectively retrieved. Brain MRIs were reviewed by a neuroradiologist, and no cerebral microbleeds were detected. Three readers (a neuroradiologist, a neurosurgeon, and an orthopedic spine surgeon) studied the cervical intervertebral discs at six different cervical levels and graded degeneration using an established five-grade scoring system. We observed no statistically significant difference in disc degeneration or any trend toward increased disc degeneration in the c-spine of football players as compared with age-matched controls. Further research is needed to validate our findings and better understand the true impact of contact sports on young athletes.}

  abstract  = {Purpose To apply deep convolution neural network to the segmentation task in myocardial arterial spin labeled perfusion imaging and to develop methods that measure uncertainty and that adapt the convolution neural network model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. Methods The Monte Carlo dropout U-Net was trained on data from 22 subjects and tested on data from 6 heart transplant recipients. Manual segmentation and regional myocardial blood flow were available for comparison. We consider 2 global uncertainty measures, named “Dice uncertainty” and “Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty,” which were calculated with and without the use of manual segmentation, respectively. Tversky loss function with a hyperparameter β was used to adapt the model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. Results The Monte Carlo dropout U-Net achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.91 ± 0.04 on the test set. Myocardial blood flow measured using automatic segmentations was highly correlated to that measured using the manual segmentation (R2 = 0.96). Dice uncertainty and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty were in good agreement (R2 = 0.64). As β increased, the false-positive rate systematically decreased and false-negative rate systematically increased. Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of deep convolution neural network for automatic segmentation of myocardial arterial spin labeling, with good accuracy. We also introduce 2 simple methods for assessing model uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to adapt the convolution neural network model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. These findings are directly relevant to automatic segmentation in quantitative cardiac MRI and are broadly applicable to automatic segmentation problems in diagnostic imaging.},

  abstract  = {Purpose Cardiac motion is a dominant source of physiological noise (PN) in myocardial arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging. This study investigates the sensitivity to heart rate variation (HRV) of double-gated myocardial ASL compared with the more widely used single-gated method. Methods Double-gating and single-gating were performed on 10 healthy volunteers (n = 10, 3F/7M; age, 23–34 years) and eight heart transplant recipients (n = 8, 1F/7M; age, 26–76 years) at rest in the randomized order. Myocardial blood flow (MBF), PN, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and HRV were measured. Results HRV ranged from 0.2 to 7.8 bpm. Double-gating PN did not depend on HRV, while single-gating PN increased with HRV. Over all subjects, double-gating provided a significant reduction in global PN (from 0.20 ± 0.15 to 0.11 ± 0.03 mL/g/min; P = 0.01) and per-segment PN (from 0.33 ± 0.23 to 0.21 ± 0.12 mL/g/min; P < 0.001), with significant increases in global temporal SNR (from 11 ± 8 to 18 ± 8; P = 0.02) and per-segment temporal SNR (from 7 ± 4 to 11 ± 12; P < 0.001) without significant difference in measured MBF. Conclusion Single-gated myocardial ASL suffers from reduced temporal SNR, while double-gated myocardial ASL provides consistent temporal SNR independent of HRV.

  abstract  = {Purpose To determine the feasibility of measuring increases in myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) on a per-segment basis using arterial spin labeled (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with adenosine vasodilator stress in normal human myocardium. Materials and Methods Myocardial ASL scans at rest and during adenosine infusion were incorporated into a routine 3T MR adenosine-induced vasodilator stress protocol and were performed in 10 healthy human volunteers. Myocardial ASL was performed using single-gated flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) tagging and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging at 3T. A T2-prep blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) SSFP sequence was used to concurrently assess segmental myocardial oxygenation with BOLD signal intensity (SI) percent change in the same subjects. Results There was a statistically significant difference between MBF measured by ASL at rest (1.75 ± 0.86 ml/g/min) compared to adenosine stress (4.58 ± 2.14 ml/g/min) for all wall segments (P < 0.0001), yielding a per-segment MPR of 3.02 ± 1.51. When wall segments were divided into specific segmental myocardial perfusion territories (ie, anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, inferior, and inferoseptal), the differences between rest and stress regional MBF for each territory remained consistently statistically significant (P < 0.001) after correcting for multiple comparisons. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring MBF and MPR on a segmental basis by single-gated cardiac ASL in normal volunteers. Second, this study demonstrates the feasibility of performing the ASL sequence and T2-prepared SSFP BOLD imaging during a single adenosine infusion.

This discovery could lead to new types of optical sensor and biomarkers at the subcellular level. We study a simple model of this new optical bio-sensor by wrapping a piece of double-stranded DNA around the surface of single-walled carbon nanotube in much the same fashion as a ribbon wraps around a cylinder. The DNA starts out wrapping around the nanotube with a certain shape that is defined by the negative charges along its backbone. Based on a theory of exciton in carbon nanotubes and we investigated transition of DNA secondary structure from the native, right-handed B form to the alternate, left-handed Z form. We've shown that our simple model can explain the working principle of this optical bio-sensor from DNA and carbon nanotubes.},
